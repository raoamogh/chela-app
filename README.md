## üöÄ About The Project

In the fast-paced, high-pressure environment of college, students are often overwhelmed by a chaotic mix of classes, assignments, competitive contests, personal projects, and hobbies. Standard productivity tools fail to provide a holistic and intelligent overview.

**Chela** solves this by acting as a personal AI guide (`Chela` means 'disciple'). It unifies a student's entire schedule and uses data-driven insights to help them stay focused, track progress, and achieve their academic goals without burning out.
